# motor-test-report
This repository contains a set of tools for performing motor test by utilizing [dynamometer series 1520 from RCbenchmark](http://www.rcbenchmark.com/product/thrust-stand-1520/) and conducting performance report from data csv file which is generated by [RCbenchmark Chrome APP](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rcbenchmarkcom-gui/loaadjknlfcpljcickkiogkbmollildg) and [the custom step test script](./custom_step_test.js).

* `custom_step_test.js` contains the script to perform a step test on target motor/propeller combination.

* `report_gen.ipynb` reads through the csv file produced by the script and generates the performance report on the combination.

## Usage
1. Perform a motor test by the dynamometer with `custom_step_test.js`. Details about using the dynamometer can be found at [RCbenchmake](https://www.rcbenchmark.com/) and the software.
2. The default installation of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) contains all the necessary packages for generating the report, install it.
3. Open the Notebook by the following command. Execute the cells line by line.
```
jupyter notebook report_gen.ipynb
```
